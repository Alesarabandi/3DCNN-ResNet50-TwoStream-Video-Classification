    "Aight, right before closing the project, I encounter something interesting in this article - [On the Integration of Optical Flow and Action Recognition (GCPR 2018)](https://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Sevilla-Lara2018GCPR.pdf), and found i quiet fascinating, so I decided to do it, but a big question pops up in my mind; ***if I already fed 16 consecutive frames to my model to detect motion, why do I even need to do so?*** tune in for the answer at the end of this phase (by end phase i mean file '7.TwoStreams.ipynb' cuz this file is only for flow extraction)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Optical Flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optical flow** is the pattern of apparent motion of objects between two consecutive frames in a video, caused by the movement of objects or the camera itself. It's a dense, pixel-wise motion field that estimates where each pixel in the first frame has moved to in the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Extract Optical Flow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical flow captures **temporal information**—what's changing over time, not just what's present in a single frame. This is crucial in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Action recognition** (like your HMDB51 project): humans move, and we care about *how* they move.\n",
    "* **Video understanding**: even a still person blinking or shifting can matter.\n",
    "* **Scene dynamics**: camera pans, zooms, or object tracking all rely on motion cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without optical flow, a model sees only *what* is in a scene. With flow, it sees *what’s happening*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### X-flow and Y-flow — What Do They Show?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you compute optical flow, the result is usually split into **two components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **x\\_flow**  — the **horizontal displacement** of pixels between two frames (left ↔ right).\n",
    "* **y\\_flow**  — the **vertical displacement** (up ↕ down).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine tracking a single pixel: If it moves 5 pixels to the right and 2 pixels up from one frame to the next, you'd have:\n",
    "$x\\_flow = +5, y\\_flow = -2$\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are usually stored as **grayscale images** where pixel intensity represents motion magnitude and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optical Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of optical flow estimation is the **brightness constancy assumption**, which says:\n",
    "\n",
    "$I(x,y,t) = I(x+\\Delta x, y+\\Delta y, t+\\Delta t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means a pixel’s brightness doesn't change as it moves; only its position does.\n",
    "Using a Taylor expansion and dropping higher-order terms, we get the **optical flow constraint equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$I_x \\cdot v_x + I_y \\cdot v_y + I_t = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $I_x$ and $I_y$ are the spatial gradients of the image\n",
    "* $I_t$ is the temporal gradient (change over time)\n",
    "* $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the optical flow components (what we're solving for)\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, algorithms like **Farneback**, **TV-L1**, or **Lucas-Kanade** are used to solve this under determined system by applying extra constraints. But I used Farneback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I Used Farneback Instead of TV-L1 for Optical Flow Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I’ve opted to use the **Farneback method** to compute dense optical flow instead of the more accurate **TV-L1 algorithm** — and here’s why;\n",
    "\n",
    "While **TV-L1** is known for producing high-quality, noise-resistant motion fields that are great for action recognition, it's also **computationally very expensive**. I ran a test and estimated that extracting flow for the entire HMDB51 dataset using TV-L1 would take over **86 hours** (you can see in the screen shot below) on my current setup — which simply isn’t practical for me right now. I’m not working with a high-end workstation or cluster, so resource constraints are a very real factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"/Users/alesarabandi/Downloads/DEEPLEARING/project/Screenshot 2025-06-17 at 18.04.22.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, I went with the **Farneback method**, which is **significantly faster** and allows me to complete the extraction in a reasonable amount of time, while still capturing the essential motion cues needed for comparing models.\n",

So, I made a list of known bad apples and deleted them manually to keep my dataset clean and consistent. It is not a big deal, they're just 16 videos from 7k, so I prefer to delete them just to prevent this small issue transform to an avalanche later. \n",
